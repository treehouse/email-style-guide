# email-style-guide
[Treehouse's Email Style Guide](https://treehouse.github.io/email-style-guide/)


## Usage

```
@import email-style
```

TODO: Document on how to include this in other projects and 3rd-party email providers.

## Development

#### Setup

```
$ bin/setup
```

#### Start Jekyll

```
$ yarn serve
```

Now open: http://localhost:4000/email-style-guide/

#### Building Assets + Docs

Running `yarn serve` will automatically build assets when they change. To build everything (such as, if you add a new directory), use:

```
$ yarn build
```

and then restart Jekyll:

```
Command+C
$ yarn serve
```

#### Clean Templates

If you ever remove templates, it's a good idea to clean-up the files generated `dist` and `docs` with:

```
$ yarn clean:templates
```

### Directory Structure

```
email-style-guide/
├── src/
│   ├── sass/
│   └── templates/
├── dist/
│    ├── css/
│    └── templates/
├── docs/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   └── templates/
```

#####  `src`

The `src` directory is where all source code is stored. Add new templates and styles here.

##### `dist`

The `dist` directory (short for distribution) is where all code is built. Running `yarn build` will generate CSS and HTML templates in this directory.

##### `docs`

The `docs` directory is where the style-guide documentation is stored.

##### `docs/assets`

The `docs/assets` directory is where all the style-guide documentation assets are stored.  Running `yarn build` will generate CSS and JavaScript in this directory.

##### `docs/templates`

Running `yarn build` will output templates to `docs/templates` as well for previewing.  In general you shouldn't add new templates here but instead add them under the `src` directory.

### Creating Templates

Add new templates to `src/templates`

**Building**

Build email templates with:

```
$ yarn build
```

**Previewing**

After you've added a template, you can preview it with Jekyll. Start the server if you haven't done so already:

```
$ yarn serve
```

Say you just added a template in: `src/templates/b2b/newsletter-08-2017.html`

Now open: http://localhost:4000/email-style-guide/templates/b2b/newsletter-08-2017.html and you should see a preview there.

**Optimizing Images**

Use TinyPNG to compress images as it often reduces file size by over 50%. For one off images (under 5MB), it's easy to just upload via their [website](https://tinypng.com/). If you have images >5MB or want to compress several images, you can do so via the API.

1. Get a [developer account](https://tinypng.com/developers) to obtain an API key.
2. In Terminal, install Tinify:
```
sudo gem install tinify
```
3. Put images in a directory.
4. Paste the script below in a file named "compress.rb" Replace APIKEY with your API key. Replace the Dir.glob file path with where your files are located. PNG and JPG files are supported, so edit the extension as needed.
```
require "tinify"
require "fileutils"

Tinify.key = "APIKEY"

FileUtils.mkdir("/Users/hopearmstrong/Desktop/compress/optimized")

Dir.glob("/Users/hopearmstrong/Desktop/compress/*.png") do |filename|
  dirname = File.dirname(filename)
  basename = File.basename(filename)
  optimized_filename = "#{dirname}/optimized/#{basename}"

  puts "Shrinking file from: #{filename} to: #{optimized_filename}"
  
  source = Tinify.from_file(filename)
  FileUtils.touch(optimized_filename)
  source.to_file(optimized_filename)
end
```
5. In Terminal, run the script:
```
ruby compress.rb
```
## Testing

We use [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) to check the documentation site + templates for broken links, missing images, invalid html, etc.

We currently run these HTMLProofer checks:

* [HtmlCheck](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#html)
* [ImageCheck](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#images)
* [LinkCheck](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#links)
* [ScriptCheck](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#scripts)

Setup the dependencies:

```
$ bin/setup
```

And then run:

```
$ yarn build && yarn test
```

Test individual templates:

```
$ bin/test src/templates/example.html
```

Any errors will appear in red text in Terminal.

## Releasing

##### Update the release notes

Update `docs/release_notes.html` with the new version number and some notes about the release.

##### Bump the version number

Update the version number, create a git tag, and push.

```
$ yarn version
$ git push --tags
```

## Deploying

This site uses Github Pages and is hosted at https://treehouse.github.io/email-style-guide/.
When a change is made to master the templates will be build and updated w/i a few minutes.
